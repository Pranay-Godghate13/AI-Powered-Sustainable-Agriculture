            1. **Review the Provided Data**:
            - Thoroughly understand the data provided by the **Farmer Advisor** and **Market Researcher**, focusing on the following key elements:
                - **Crop preferences**: The farmer’s preferred crops for cultivation.
                - **Financial goals**: The farmer's financial objectives, including expected profit margins, return on investment, and cost efficiency.
                - **Environmental and agricultural data**: Water availability, soil health, climate conditions, and resource constraints.

            2. **Re-rank Crop Options ["Wheat", "Rice", "Soyabean","Corn"]**:
            - **Re-evaluate and re-rank the crops** based on the following priority criteria:
                - **Minimizing resource consumption**: Favor crops that use less **water** and require fewer **chemical inputs** (fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides).
                - **Achieving the farmer’s financial goals**: Prioritize crops that align with the farmer’s **profitability targets** and are well-suited to the available resources.
                - **Sustainability**: Consider how each crop impacts the environment, promoting sustainable practices such as soil health and water conservation.
            
            - **Justify the ranking**: For each crop in your new ranking, provide clear reasons for its placement based on its **water usage**, **chemical dependency**, and alignment with **financial goals**. Highlight the pros and cons of each crop, using data-driven insights.

            3. **Compare with Farmer’s Crop Preferences**:
            - After completing the ranking, compare the **top two ranked crops** with the **farmer's crop preferences**.
                - **Check if the top two ranked crops are part of the farmer’s preferred crops** list.

            4. **Provide Actionable Insights**:

            - **If one or both of the top two ranked crops are in the farmer’s crop preferences**:
                - **Provide insights for the top-ranked crop**:
                - Explain **why this crop is the best option**, considering factors like financial viability, environmental sustainability, and resource usage.
                - Offer **practical, actionable advice**:
                    - **Best farming practices** for optimal yield.
                    - Recommendations for water management, pest control, and soil enhancement.
                    - Financial forecasting and risk management to maximize returns.
                - **Suggest the second-ranked crop** as an alternative, with brief reasoning on why it could still be a viable option, and how it compares to the first crop in terms of resources and financial outcomes.
            
            - **If neither of the top two ranked crops is in the farmer’s crop preferences**:
                - **Present a better alternative crop**: Provide a compelling reason for why a crop outside the farmer’s preferred list is a better choice, based on its ability to meet the farmer’s **financial goals**, **sustainability criteria**, and **resource availability**.
                - **Justification**: Explain why your recommended crop is **better than the farmer's initial choices**, focusing on:
                - **Lower water usage** and **fewer chemicals** required.
                - **Higher profitability potential** or better fit with the farmer's available resources.
                - **Provide actionable insights** on how to grow and manage the recommended crop:
                - Suggest **best farming practices**, such as optimal planting techniques, irrigation methods, and pest control strategies.
                - Identify **potential challenges** and offer solutions for overcoming them.
                - **Suggest an alternative crop**: Provide the second-ranked crop as an alternative option, with justification based on the farmer’s needs.

            5. **Actionable Recommendations for Success**:
            - **Offer detailed guidance** on how to grow the suggested crops, ensuring the farmer can achieve both their financial and sustainability goals:
                - **Water management**: Provide actionable strategies for optimizing irrigation and reducing water waste.
                - **Soil health**: Recommend methods for enhancing soil quality and fertility.
                - **Pest and disease control**: Advise on reducing reliance on chemicals by using sustainable pest management practices.
                - **Market insights**: Provide suggestions on market trends, pricing strategies, and how to maximize profits from the recommended crops"""
